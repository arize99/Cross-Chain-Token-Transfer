# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

FOR TEST PURPOSES.
***********************************************************************************************************************************************************

For testing purposes, you can use the following sample data to simulate different cross-chain transfer scenarios:

From Chain:
You can use names of popular blockchain networks, such as:

Ethereum
Binance Smart Chain
Polygon
Avalanche
Solana


To Chain:
Use a different chain name from the "From Chain" field. For example:

If "From Chain" is Ethereum, you could use "Polygon" here
If "From Chain" is Binance Smart Chain, you could use "Avalanche" here


Recipient Address:
For testing, you can use example Ethereum addresses. These should be 42 characters long, starting with "0x". Here are a few sample addresses you can use:

0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e
0x8Ba1f109551bD432803012645Ac136ddd64DBA72
0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7


Amount:
You can enter any numerical value here. For example:

10
0.5
100.25



Here's a complete example you could use:

Amount: 50.5
From Chain: Ethereum
To Chain: Polygon
Recipient Address: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e

This is a simulation; the app will accept any input as long as all fields are filled and the amount is valid. In a real application, there would be more stringent validation for chain names, address formats, and available balances.
